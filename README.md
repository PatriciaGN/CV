## About me :smile_cat:

Curious and creative human, avid learner, veterinary surgeon and software developer. 

I considered moving countries one of the most challenging things I had ever done, until I decided to switch careers into IT and found myself starting all over again once more, but life would be so boring without a good challenge, wouldn’t it?

Although I had made some basic websites on HTML as a teenager, for some reason I had never pictured software development as something I could do as a job. Two years ago, I started playing with Python during my spare time and realised it was something I actually enjoyed doing. Since then, I have finished the 16 weeks Makers Academy Software Development bootcamp, where I have learnt all I needed to start building applications from scratch, as well as a lot of soft skills. Being at Makers has been one of the most intense but also most rewarding experiences in my life, and I still can't believe how much I have grown since we started it!

I have found in tech what I always looked for: lots of situations that can be dealt with using problem solving and a good amount of creativity, unlimited chances for drinking tea and the fact that I can make my own video-games! I am passionate about problem solving and continuous-learning and love being able to work in an industry where I have to use my brain all the time.

I am looking for a company that values the individual, their opinions and ideas, that advocates for diversity and inclusion and where the team's culture and wellbeing is as important as the product they create. I am also very interested on finding a job where code quality and best practices are expected and encouraged and that will support my learning and my journey to become the best software developer I can be.

## Work experience :construction_worker:

**Steamship circus** (August 2022 - current)

_Circus artist_
* Work as a performer doing walkabouts.
* Currently training to become a fire-performer (dragon staff and fire fans) and in aerial-hoop.
* Working within a circus company was one of those things I never thought I would do, but so far it has been an incredible experience. I have had to teach myself a different kind of discipline to be persistent and train every week. At the same time, I have gained better understanding on how to empathise and entertain the public while ensuring health and safety meassures were in place to keep myself and the team safe.

**Vets4Pets Poole** (May 2021 – June 2022)

_Veterinary surgeon_
* Consultations, diagnostics and soft tissue surgery. Lead ultrasonographer.
* In this position I had the exciting oportunity to teach and mentor both veterinary and nursing students as well as nurses that were training to become ultrasonographers. Every time I had an interesting case coming in, I would call the students or save images to discuss them later on as I believed in the importance of using every possible oportunity to learn.
* Working in this practice helped me improve my problem-solving abilities when dealing with complicated clinical cases, as well as coming up with creative solutions by thinking outside the box. As an example, unlike the rest of my colleagues, I was very keen in using local-anaesthetics for simple surgeries when a general anaesthesia imposed a risk to the patient, like in a 2 week old puppy that had a congenital defect.

**Natterjacks vet** (February 2019 – March 2021)

_Veterinary surgeon_
* Consultations, diagnostics and soft tissue surgery. Lead ultrasonographer.
* This job helped me improve my time-management even when we were under time pressure or needing to multitask, as it was a very fast-paced job with ten minutes consults and lots of things to do on the side.
* I also found a love in working within a large team, in where being a colleague was a synonym of a friend and where we would all care for each other and help each other thrive. 

**Centro Veterinario Cania** (June 2015 – October 2016 and October 2017 – January 2019)

_Sole charge Veterinary surgeon_
* Consultations, diagnostics and soft tissue surgery. Lead ultrasonographer. 
* This practice and its owner gave me my first job opportunity and taught me what being responsible of a business meant, as well as improving my self-confidence when working unsupervised, having to trust my own knowledge and abilities.
* We did a lot of charity work aided by residents of the area for the stray cat colonies. I found the possibility of helping the community and animals in need extremely rewarding and it allowed me to meet some wonderful people. 

**Lockwood Animal Hospital, CV Antartida, CV los Juncos, Briar hourse vets** (May 2017 - September 2018)

_Locum Veterinary surgeon_
* Consultations, diagnostics and soft tissue surgery in different practices both across Spain and the UK.
* I enjoyed exploring a variety of ways to work and it helped me to learn how to thrive independently of the circumstances around me.

**Serendipia – Rock band** (October 2015 – 2018)

_Lead singer_
* Performed at several pubs and festivities.
* This position required a lot of team-work, creativity and organisation in terms of arranging rehearshals and finding gigs, but it was also incredibly rewarding and fun. I also learned how to sell our product effectively. 
* Before doing this, the thought of going on a stage seemed really scary, but I learnt to overcome my fears, speak in public and keep people entertained.


## Skills - What can I bring to your team? :bulb:

### Team worker and good communicator
I love meeting new people, getting to know their stories and creating meaningful relationships. I also enjoy creating a safe and comfortable space for the people around me, where communication and emotional intelligence are the key to achieving an environment where everyone feels respected, valued and appreciated. I am also happy to act as a mediator if the situation arises and enjoy mentoring or leading where appropriate. For example, during the course, there were times in which we were paired with people that was far behind in the exercises. I always tried to take the time to help and revise the contents, finding better ways of explaining the concepts, which aided with my own learning.

Although I work very well independently and I am capable to stay focused and motivated, I prefer to do so within a team, where people with different ideas and perspectives are able to come to a much more balanced solution to a problem. 

In my previous roles as a vet, I have had the need to communicate effectively with my clients in order to manage expectations regarding their pets' health conditions, the treatments we had available and the cost, while taking into account each inidivual's personal situation and boundaries. This has been one of the most challenging parts of my job, but also the one from which I have learnt the most, and that has had the most impact in client satisfaction and appreciation. 

During my time at Makers Academy, communication was the skill that I found more useful. From talking about expectations and boundaries before a pairing session to trying to put into words complex technical ideas. In one of our group projects, a member of the team was feeling very overwhelmed and was finding it difficult to continue working, so we use one of our stand-up sessions to discuss reasons, possible solutions, explain how everyone was feeling and offer our support. This resulted in a much better working environment going forward.

### Critical thinking, Agile methodologies, decision-making and prioritising
As a vet, it has also been very important to be able to prioritise and communicate well with my team, especially on moments in which we had to work under time pressure, like in an emergency situation. We once got a dog that was struggling to breath and only had a few minutes to react before things got worse. I had to quickly trace a plan, give instructions and calculate doses while placing a canula to give the medication, which resulted on that dog being discharged later on that day and living a happy life.

At Makers Academy, there have been plenty of situations in which we were under time pressure, especially during group projects. In this setting, where we only had one or two weeks to develop a project, the planning part of the process became the most important. We used an Agile methodology on these projects, having a solid but adaptable plan, that we could easily change depending on the requirements. For example, during our final project, we spent two days brain-storming and planning our application, and then we divided our group into teams that would pick up a feature and work on it. We would have stand-ups and retros three times a day to discuss our progress, how we were feeling and ask others for help if needed.

### Problem-solving and high attention to detail
If you think about it, being a veterinary surgeon is not that different from being a software developer, which means I have over six years of experience in problem solving under my belt. In both cases, you are presented with a list of problems you have to try find a solution for and, often, coming up with this solution requires a lot of planning, studying, asking other people, looking for the small details, thinking outside the box and practising trial and error. You want to focus on solving each individual problem but keeping in mind the bigger picture to get the best outcome.

For example, once I got presented with an elderly cat that, according to the owner, was eating better than ever and seemed generally well in himself, although he wasn’t putting any weight on despite emptying two bowls of food a day. I suspected something wasn’t quite right and obtained permission to take bloods, which revealed an onset of a hyperactive thyroid. From there, we developed a plan of action to get this cat back in track before he could develop any secondary health issues.

During the bootcamp, I have realised that there was, most of the time, more than one correct way of solving a problem. I have also enjoyed comparing my exercises to other people's and seeing how they approached a certain problem.

### Adaptable

Learning new things and challenging myself is what keeps me motivated! In my previous roles I have had to try and learn lots of surgeries from only seeing them done once and then replicate the process, as well as constantly improve my techniques with practice and studying.

Transitioning from Veterinary Medicine to Software Development required me to gain a lot of knowledge in a short space of time, and although I could use a lot of the skills I learnt previously, there was the constant pressure of learning new technologies and challenging ourselves. It has been really hard at times, but I have come out being both more resilient but also able to ask for help when needed. For example, at the beginning of the course I found it difficult to approach the coaches to ask them questions when I got stuck, and I would stay stuck for several hours before I found a solution on my own, but later on I learnt to do so at the right time, which made my learning more fluid and boosted my confidence.

### Emotionally intelligent and feedback-lover

Customer-facing isn’t always easy and most people know that, but it is all about appearing confident and communicating clearly, about letting the client know that you are there to help them and will do as much as you can so that they are satisfied, but also about setting your own boundaries with them.

During my working years I have encountered all sorts of customers. Some were lovely and would bring me chocolates for helping their beloved dog or cat, in some exceptional cases, some would be distrustful or disrespectful, but to all of them I was always professional and tried to make them leave with the sense that we had done the best we could for their pets. I always felt very proud when clients requested me personally for their consultations!

During Makers, we have underwent an extensive Emotional Intelligence curriculum covering topics from personality types to communication and feedback. Although my previous roles helped be become a more empathic and emotionally aware person, it has been wonderful to have all this concepts explained to us.

After most of my pairing sessions and group projects, I have asked for feedback, as I am willing to take on board any potential improvements that can make the experience easier for the people involved and help me grow. I also try to give constructive feedback when appropriate.


## Education :books:

#### Makers Academy (September 2022 – December 2022) 
* During this time, we have done daily pairing sessions in order to problem solve efficiently, requiring teamwork and good communication. This was one of my favourite parts of the course, as it gave us an opportunity to learn from each other, as well as support each other through such an intensive experience.
* We have also used TDD from the very beginning, learning the value of taking longer to reach a solution in order to write good quality and fully tested code that is easy to debug and change. 
* During the course, we have used a wide variety of technologies and taught how to learn new ones from scratch, as well as approaching complicated problems by breaking them in smaller ones. This way of thinking has also helped me with some personal situations!

#### Masters in High school Sciences teaching (Catholic University of Murcia, Spain, 2017)
* This masters helped me understand how learning works and what the best techniques for teaching and explaining are, which I found very interesting.
* I did a placement after my Masters and realised that, as much as I loved learning and teaching, working with teenagers wasn’t for me and decided to continue with my career as a veterinary surgeon.

#### Degree in Veterinary Medicine (University of Murcia, Spain. 2009 –  2015)
* Mean qualifications 8.3/10, nine of the core subjects passed with distinctions.
* Intensification in Medicine and surgery.
* Intern student in the Anaesthesia department.


## Additional learning :pencil2:

* GPCert in Small Animal Surgery (December 2019 – September 2022)
   GP level specialisation in surgery, which helped me become more confident in my procedures and my communication with clients.

* Advanced level of spoken and written English (Spanish School of languages – 2016)

* Advanced level of spoken and written English (Cambridge Advanced Exam – 2015)

* Basic German and French (level A2)

## Hobbies  :art:

I am very glad you have made it this far, because this is my favourite part of all!. I am not too sure of where to start though...

I love being creative, and that includes writing (whether it is on my [blog](https://www.catfromspace.com), on my diary or the odd poem), drawing and painting (you have a link to my deviantart [here](https://www.deviantart.com/the-horse-rider)), woodburning, doing crochet or crossed-stitch, photography… I am always excited about trying some new form of craft.

Music is another one of my passions, I love singing and have recorded several self-produced albums  with my father, as well as composed some songs myself and was part of a rock band. I will attend to as many gigs as I can, both in small pubs or large venues, and enjoy going to a few festivals during the summer time.

I also enjoy being active:
* I am currently doing a walking/running/cycling Lord of the Rings themed challenge (because fantasy and reading are also my thing), around 3000km in total. I particularly love hiking in nature or walking along the shore.
* Weekly yoga sessions also helps keeping my body and my mind healthy.
* I have recently picked-up on aerial hoop which is allowing me to gain core strength and it is also a lot of fun!
* I am also learning to be a fire-performer (currently learning dragon staff and fire-fans) and enjoying regular jams to spin and learn from other people.

One of my dreams if being able to travel everywhere, maybe even one day working from a campervan, in a different country every fortnight. I love discovering new cultures, architecture, ways of life and gastronomy. I am currently saving to travel to Thailand, Japan and New Zealand, whilst trying to do some trips to Europe every year.
